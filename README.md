# KEBOT
This was an early beta I made for viewing SQL data for my company.  This was to automate reports in an easy to use way.

To launch: 

Go to the application file and click on KEBOT.exe. The Application will download.


For it to work, it has to have access to the SQL database.

To access data, click on the machine you wish to view and then the report type. Also, select the Date range you wish to see as well.
